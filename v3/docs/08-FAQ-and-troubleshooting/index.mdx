Developers building with Substrate may come into issues with mismatched versions or breaking changes that result in incompatibility issues.
This page is a living document of how to work around these types of common issues.

## Using PolkadotJS Apps with a Substrate node that does not yet use the `scale-info` pallet 

*Issue*: The hosted PolkadotJS apps UI no longer requires adding custom metadata.
Instead, it expects the Substrate node to use `scale_info::TypeInfo` on all its custom enums and structs.
Chains that have not been updated to include the `scale-info` crate will not be able to pass in custom types to the latest version of PolkadotJS Apps.

*Solution*: Use an older version of PolkadotJS Apps.

The last release that includes the custom types in the UI is `v0.96.1`, [available here](https://github.com/polkadot-js/apps/releases/tag/v0.96.1).

1. Clone PolkadotJS apps v0.96.1. 

    ```bash
    git clone --depth=1 git@github.com:polkadot-js/apps.git --branch v0.96.1
    ```

1. Install and start the UI locally.
    
    Ensure that you have a recent LTS version of Node.js and Yarn. f
    For development purposes Node >=10.13.0 is recommended and Yarn >=1.10.1 is required.

    ```bash
    yarn install 
    yarn start
    ```

1. Access the UI at http://localhost:3000.
 
1. Go to **Settings -> Developer** page and paste in your chain's custom types. 

    For example, if you are doing the [permissioned network tutorial](/tutorials/v3/permissioned-network/) with an older Substrate chain, you would add:

    ```json
    {
    "PeerId": "(Vec<u8>)"
    }
    ```

    If you don't do this, you will get extrinsic errors of the form: `Verification Error: Execution(ApiError(Could not convert parameter 'tx' between node and runtime)`.
    See more details about the error [here](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/api/FAQ#the-node-returns-a-could-not-convert-error-on-send).

Note that it is highly recommended to include `scale-info` in your node.
Using it is a very powerful and useful feature which was introduced [in this PR](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/8615).

## Persisting data when running a node in `--dev` mode

*Issue*: When running a chain in developer mode, the `--tmp` flag is implied by default.
The `--tmp` flag implies that a temporary directory is created and used as a basepath to store a database, keystore and node key. 
Once the chain is stopped, this directory is deleted.
Now that the `--tmp` flag is implied by default, some developers may want to have their chain's database persist between starting and stopping their chain.

*Solution*: Provide an explicit base path.
1. Name your base path, for example `tmp/base-path`.

1. Run the node template and specify your base path.

    ```bash
    ./target/release/node-template --dev  --base-path /tmp/base-path
    ```

With this, you can stop your chain and when you restart it, it will resume on the last finalized block.
See [the original PR](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/9938) for more details on this change.
